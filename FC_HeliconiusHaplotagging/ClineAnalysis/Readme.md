Included here are the Mathematic notebook created by Nick Barton to analyze the parallel hybrid zone data.

The complete code is included to allow users to explore various alternative scenarios.

We also include PDF versions of the same notebook to help those who may not have a Mathematica license. We have also included a computable document format (CDF) version, which you may open using the free CDF player.

In addition, the bash and R code used for cline analysis of the most strongly differentiated SNP per 100 kbp window is given here.
