In this folder we keep a number of scripts for running HAPCUT2.

To run the standard HAPCUT2 steps using linked-read information, see: `hapcut.sge.sh`. 

To run a the complex HAPCUT2 molecular phasing steps and integrating the data with STITCH-generated genotype VCF file, see: `hapcutVcf.helera1_demo.sh`.

Note that `hapcutVcf.helera1_demo.sh` is provided here as an actual illustrative example. There are many sample name pre- and suffixes that are specific to the dataset. The script as such would not be runnable without modification.
